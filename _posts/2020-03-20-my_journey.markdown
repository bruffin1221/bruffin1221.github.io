I took a long and circuitous route to Flatiron and software engineering. Just look at my resume, and you would see a very different journey. My career started with a two year stint in AmeriCorp, where I began a financial literacy program. Then I worked at several youth-serving organizations. My accomplishments included starting a program that helped youth save for college and coordinating youth activities at a housing development. As these jobs ended, I really wanted to run non-profit. So, I went to seminary, and worked at a youth outreach organization. Upon graduation, I continued working with youth. 

 Unfortunately, the years serving youth and working with the poor took a toll on me. Each heart-wrenching story left me emotionally and mentally drained.  It got so bad that I dealt with bouts of depression and anxiety. This led me to quit my job and focus on raising my son and personal training.  During my time working with nonprofits I earned my personal training certification and worked with a small group of clients. As part of my training business, I built a tiny Wordpress blog and website that served as a creative outlet. 

During this time I discovered the world of technology, software engineering, and app development. I witnessed how  technology impacted the fitness industry through apps, wearables, and improved training equipment. Then in youthwork technology played an ever-increasing role. Youthworkers through apps scheduled meetings and planned events. They also aided in the academic and personal development of young people. Moreover, several family members worked as programmers.  Each spoke about fascinating and groundbreaking projects. One worked with artificial intelligence and another worked on government sattelites. As a result of these experiences, I gained an interest in technology. 

The problem was how could I learn to code.  First, I tried teaching myself but got lost in the different languages. Then school cost over $100,000.  Finally, someone suggested bootcamps and it turned out they provided the best option. Though expensive, they did not break the bank. Additionally, I could delve into computers and programming.  My research brought me to Flatiron with its flexible programming. Now as I work my way through the program. I am really excited.  After graduation I can combine my love of technology with other interests and passions. Some of my ideas include a platform geared toward active living and a project that helps young people learn about technology and entreprenuership.
